# Kidney_Stone_Detection
This project applies machine learning techniques to detect the presence of kidney stones using patient data. Developed as part of the IBM Virtual Internship on Artificial Intelligence, the project simulates a real-world healthcare AI application where early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes.

# ü©∫ Kidney Stone Detection ‚Äì IBM Virtual Internship Project

A machine learning classification project that predicts the presence of kidney stones based on patient health data.  
This project was completed during the IBM Artificial Intelligence Virtual Internship and simulates a healthcare use-case for early diagnosis using AI.

## üîç Objective
Build a machine learning model that:
- Predicts whether a patient has a kidney stone or not
- Analyzes key medical features (symptoms, test results)
- Demonstrates AI's potential in healthcare diagnostics

---

## üõ† Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## üß™ Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and categorical variables  
   - Normalized numeric features

2. **Model Building**  
   - Trained classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Used accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix  
   - Visualized feature importance and model performance
